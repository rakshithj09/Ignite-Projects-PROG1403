# Ignite Projects Semester 2

## Overview
This repository contains all programming assignments completed for PROG1403.  
Each homework focuses on a different Python concept, including loops, functions, input handling, file processing, CSV reading, and text parsing. (Could be edited)

## Project List

### Homework 1 – Counting Weekends
This assignment calculates how many weekends fall between two user-entered dates.
It accepts multiple date formats, validates input, and counts full, Saturday-only, and Sunday-only weekends.
The program uses the `datetime` module and allows repeated runs through a user prompt.

### Homework 2 – Contact List #1
Menu-driven contact manager that lets users add, import, view, export, and delete contacts.
Birthdays accept multiple date formats and each contact’s current age is computed from today’s date.
Contacts persist via `Contacts.csv` inside the Homework 2 folder, so the console output and exports stay in sync.
